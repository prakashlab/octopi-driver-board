This PR provides a new board for the Octopi Driver Stack. This board, named {INSERT NAME CODE HERE} __({INSERT FULL NAME HERE})__, {INSERT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IT DOES HERE}. More information about this board is available in the README.md file for this board.

This PR will be used to keep track of previews and manufacturing files prior to a freeze on the `ODSv1.0.0-{{INSERT NAME CODE HERE}}v0.1.0` tag. The PR will be merged once the prototype-stage manufacturing order (red PCBs) is placed. Afterwards, additional comments should be added to document any errata or testing results from assembled prototypes, or required changes for the next version can be recorded directly in Github Issues.
